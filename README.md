Othello on Android
===============

This is a mirror repository of the Othello on Android project completed in July 2012 in CSCE 315. 
The original repository can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/team3-othello/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FAndroid%2FOthello)
The team on this application included myself, Dylan McDougall, and Sam Stewart.

This application is built with Android SDK Version 15, and has been made compatible with SDK Version 8.
Included here is the entire Eclipse project folder used in the creation of this application. 
You may load this folder into Eclipse as is, or if you would like to test the application on an Android device,
Othello.apk is also included, at /bin/Othello.apk
